# **Rx**Swift
## *The flow of app state*

> *[An app] is not something that you just dump something on. It's not a big truck.* It's a series of tubes.
-- Ted Stevens

^ One of the more overused memes out there, but it can actually be a pretty helpful metaphor.

Let it flow

^ Use case: an app that can search for GitHub repositories and display them in a list

# Imperative

1. Listen for search button callback (target/action)
2. Read value of text field and **call** search API
3. Listen for search API callback (block)
4. **Parse** response and **update** data source with models
5. **Reload** table view and configre/display cells

---

# Reactive

1. Describe search query as a **relationship** between the text field and the search button
2. Describe **transformation** from search text to API response
3. Describe **transformation** from response to cell models
4. Create **binding** from cell models to the table view

```swift
let foo = Observable<String>
